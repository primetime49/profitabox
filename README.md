Is that movie a Boom or Bomb? Find out here.

Steps:
1. Create datasets first by running 'python create.py'. Specify filename for the result and years for the movies you want in dataset.
2. Update regularly by running 'python update.py'. Specify the filename and year. I usually update the datasets every tuesday and only for the current year.
3. You can reformat the csv results into excel for better reading. Samples can be found in /sample
4. Run 'python gui.py' to launch the Profitabox GUI. With the GUI you can search movies and look at their data more easily.
